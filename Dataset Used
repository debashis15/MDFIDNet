## Datasets Used

MDFIDNet was trained and tested on a combination of synthetic grayscale, synthetic color, and real-world image datasets, ensuring comprehensive validation across diverse scenarios.

### **Synthetic Grayscale Images**
- **Training Dataset**: BSD400 (a subset of the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset).
- **Testing Dataset**: BSD68 (a benchmark dataset of 68 grayscale images for denoising).

### **Synthetic Color Images**
- **Training Dataset**: CBSD432 (a color extension of BSD400 with 432 images).
- **Testing Dataset**: BSD68 (68 color images derived from the grayscale BSD68 dataset).

### **Real-World Noisy Images**
- **Training Dataset**: SIDD (Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset) training set.
- **Testing Datasets**:
  - **SIDD Validation Set**: A subset of SIDD images used for validation.
  - **PolyU**: A real noisy image dataset developed by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
  - **NAM**: Noise-Aware Model dataset, containing various real noisy scenarios.

These datasets collectively ensure robust performance testing under both synthetic and real-world noise conditions.
