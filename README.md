# MDFIDNet: Multi-Domain Feature Integration Denoising Network

Welcome to the official repository for **MDFIDNet**, a novel image denoising model leveraging **Multi-Domain Feature Integration** to achieve superior denoising performance. 

## About MDFIDNet
MDFIDNet introduces an advanced approach to image denoising by integrating features from multiple domains, including:
- **Spatial domain** for detailed pixel-level processing.
- **Gradient domain** for edge preservation and texture enhancement.
- **Cosine domain** for frequency-based noise suppression.

This methodology ensures a balance between noise reduction and detail preservation, making it a powerful tool for a variety of real-world applications.
